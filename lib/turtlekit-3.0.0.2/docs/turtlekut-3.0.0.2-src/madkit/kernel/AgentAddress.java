/**
 * Identifies an agent within the artificial society.
 * <p>
 * How this class works is very different from the previous versions of MaDKit. 
 * More precisely, it now corresponds to a CGR location (community;group;role) 
 * where the agent is in. So, an agent may have several AgentAddress
 * as it could join many CGR locations.
 * <p>
 * Moreover, if the related agent leaves the corresponding CGR location,
 * then an AgentAddress becomes invalid and no longer permits to reach
 * this agent. For instance, a message sent using 
 * {@link AbstractAgent#sendMessage(AgentAddress, Message)}
 * will not be delivered if the agent has leaved the related CGR location.
