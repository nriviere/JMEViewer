//* although the default fields of a message could not be altered by receivers (read only or copy),
//* other messages (subclasses of Message) and their content could be intercepted via the hooking mechanism of the kernel.
//* Thus, additional content could be altered by receivers if not read only.
//* Implementing the <code>SecuredMessage</code> interface 
//* (and Overriding the default <code>clone</code> method of <code>Message</code>; Do not forget to call super.clone())
//* will tell the kernel
//* to do a copy of the message for each receiver, ensuring the data security of the original object/content used to build a message.
